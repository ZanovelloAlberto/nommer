# DOCS
i get ghc dependency throught `ghc-pkg list`.
ghc-pkg create a database probably stored in the ghc package.
i can create a local one and load deps locally with 
command `ghc-pkg register /nix/store/...`.

# COMPLETION
there is no go to definiton, 
we probably need to use cabal to have that, 
not sure nixpkgs provide source of definitions

# DICT
- stack (deps,building)
- cabal (deps,building)
